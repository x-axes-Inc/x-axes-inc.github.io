							<h1>Living with Demand-Side Changes: A Report for Planning a Convenience Store in Liverpool with Click-and-Collect Facilities </h1>
							<t1>Spring 22' | Applied GIS Report | Coursework Assignment  |  Liverpool, UK</t1>
						</t1><br><br><p2>1. Introduction</h1><br>
							<p>Traditional high-street retail faces crippling challenges due to consumer behaviour changes in the digital era (Great British High Street, 2020). However, few studies have prioritised demand-side indicators in shaping store locations, including consumer propensity for online shopping during the COVID (Pantano et al., 2020). This report attempts to apply GIS analysis to demand and supply appraisals, precluding inappropriate locations and selecting the optimal option for a new convenience store in Liverpool with click-and-collect facilities.
													

							</p>
							<p2>2. Methodology</h1><br>
							<p>This study adopts location planning criteria proposed by Roig-Tierno et al. (2013; Figure 1). The first two steps identify areas supplied with adequate demand, minimal competition, and maximum commercial opportunities. The next two stages select allocation points suitable for retail development from opportunity areas and assess their socio-demographic conditions by the analogue store approach (Hood et al., 2016).</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic06.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p4>* Results generated in this report derive from LSOA1 statistics, road networks, and POI data (provided by ONS2, CDRC3, OS4, UK GOV and Geolytix) and processed by QGIS and ArcGIS.

								<br><p2>3. Results</h1><br>
										<p3>Stage 1: Customer profile analysis</h1>	
											<p>This step delineates areas with sufficient onsite and online consumers. Parcels with all-day potential footfall above the city median, IMD income deprivation score lower than the city median, as well as a greater-than-national-average prevalence of buying groceries online (Figure 2-4), are determined as opportunity areas (Figure 5).

												<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic40.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic41.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											</p>
										<br><p3>Stage 2: Business condition analysis</h1>	
											<p>This step eliminates areas with little business prospects. Taking travel barriers into account (Thornton et al., 2012), road network buffers, rather than Euclidian distance, are used to exclude locations inside the catchments of perceived competitors (Figure 6-7). Also, locations outside the Liverpool retail centre buffers are dismissed, as retail agglomeration present more shopping opportunities to costumers (Figure 8; Eppli & Benjamin, 2020).

											<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic44.jpg" alt="" /></span>	
												</p>
										<br><p3>Stage 3: Land suitability analysis</h1>
											<p>Allocation points are sifted from opportunity areas based on accessibility and land use (Figure 9). Street intersections are considered more permeable than cul-de-sacs or large urban blocks. Areas inside residences or near strategic routes are more suitable for commercial development, compared with the industrial, historic, or ecological zones.	
												<span class="image main"><img src= "images/pic45.jpg" alt="" /></span>
													</p>	<p3>Stage 4: Analogue store approach
														<p>Two c-stores with click-and-collect services provide standards for evaluating social-demographic characteristics of the options' catchments (Figure 10). Option 5 not only contains the greatest footfall, the second-wealthiest populations, a relatively high online grocery shopping prevalence and the least competition among seven options, but also outperforms analogue stores on almost every indicator (Table 1 & 2).

												<br><p2>4. Discussion</h1><br>
													<p>Option 5 (L15 6YB) is subject to site inspections recommended by Wood & Browne (2007). Surrounding parking and bus stops give this two-story shop easy access; the synergy of retailers along bustling and diversified street frontages provides it with massive customers (Figure 11, Karande & Lombard, 2005). The gable roof shown in Figure 12 demonstrates great visibility; the use of a vacant plot promotes efficient land use.</p>

													<br><p2>5. Conclusion</h1><br>
														<p>This study focusses on c-store planning strategies with click-and-collect facilities, offering guidance on high street revitalization under the digital trend. By adopting consumer analysis in the initial screening and final selection optimisation stages, it compensates insufficient attention devoted to the demand side. Given the paucity of data below LSOA levels, the ambiguity of analogue shop selection (Wood & Brown, 2007), and the limitations of GIS techniques (Hernandez & Bennison, 2000), methodological improvements are still needed.</p>
